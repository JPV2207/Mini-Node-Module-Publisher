# Mini-Node-Module-Publisher


A simple and cheerful Node.js module that returns a friendly message. Great as a first npm package and a personal learning milestone!

function hello() {
  return "Hey! This is my mini module. Cheers!";
}
````

## 🛠️ Usage

Create a file (like `test.js`) and use:

```js
const hello = require("your-npm-username-my-mini-module");

console.log(hello());
// Output: Hey! This is my mini module. Cheers!
```
